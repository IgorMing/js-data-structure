# JS Data Structure

Just to play a bit with data structures in JavaScript.

> I've written the code with TDD, so, we have the tests already done.

## Current problem

- **mergeList()** - When I run the tests related with merge list, we reach 100%+ CPU usage from v8. And the engine also crashes everytime.

## Run

Running the tests

```
yarn test
```
